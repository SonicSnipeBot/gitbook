#### Select Contract

Select a contract for trading using the **Select Contract** option. Sonic Snipe Bot displays a list of available contracts ordered from most recent to least recent. Each contract shows:

* **Total Tokens**: The total number of tokens across all wallets.
* **Total Initial Price**: The cumulative price paid across all wallets.
* **Total Worth**: The current total worth across all wallets.
* **Wallets List**: A list of wallets that have bought the contract.

**Actions:**

* Transfer Tokens: Click 'Transfer' to move tokens between contracts.
* **Select a Contract**: Choose the desired contract by clicking its associated button.
* **Delete a Contract**: Remove a contract by pressing 'Delete' next to its name.
* **Select Wallet**: Prior to selecting a contract, choose the wallet you want to trade from, especially if you hold the same tokens in multiple wallets.

After selecting a contract, the [Single Snipe Menu](https://github.com/SonicSnipeBot/sonicSnipeBot/wiki/Snipe-Menu) will display the selected wallet and contract. To return to the Contracts Menu, click "Contracts".
