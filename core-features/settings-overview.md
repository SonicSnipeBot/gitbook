### Gas Limit <a href="#gas-limit" id="gas-limit"></a>

To enter the gas limit menu, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the settings menu.
2. Select the "Gas Limit" option.

You can also access this using the quick panel by simply typing `/limit`.

**Gas Limit Menu has 3 Options**

1. **Auto Gas Limit** - This will attempt to automatically set the Gas Limit provided by the Website API (You can toggle this On and Off).
2. **Default Gas Limit** - When **Auto Gas Limit** is turned off, the **Default Gas Limit** will be used.\
   **Default Gas Limit** will also take effect when the **Estimated Gas Limit** cannot be calculated from the Rpc Provider.
3. **Leverage Gas Limit** - This is the amount on top of the **Auto Gas Limit** amount provided by the **Website Gas Limit** Calculation. This only applies if **Auto Gas Limit** is on.\
   This Also Applies if **Estimated Gas Limit**\* was used.

**Note** A World 🌎 Symbol Will Appear if the Website Api Was Used to Retrieve the Gas Limit.\
No world symbol means the Estimated Gas Was Calculated from the Rpc Provider.

Quick Configuration Also Supported, for example: `/limit 500000` \
(This will set your Default Gas Limit to 500,000.)

### Gas Price <a href="#gas-price" id="gas-price"></a>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-06-06 at 12.51.18 PM.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**To enter the Gas Price Menu, follow these steps:**

1. Navigate to the settings menu.
2. Select the "Gas Price" option.

You can also access this using the quick panel by simply typing `/gas`.

**Gas Price has 4 Dynamic Gas Price Options: Low, Medium, High, Instant (Available on compatible EVM networks)**

*   **Low, Medium, High, and Instant** - These options are dynamically updated and fetched from the Website API and Rpc Provider, this will be used when you trade based on your selection.

    _Example_: If you select "High," your Dynamic Gas will always be on the high setting.
*   **Tip option** - This allows you to add a tip for miners. Tipping can potentially prioritise your transaction, especially during times of network congestion.

    \
    &#xNAN;_**How to use Tip Option**_**:**

    After selecting the "Gas Price" option:

    1. You will see a "Tip" button, depicted by a rocket emoji.
    2. Click on the "Tip" button to specify the amount you wish to tip.
    3. Enter the amount for the tip, which will be added to the gas fee of your transaction.

    **Quick Tip Shortcut**: To quickly access the tip option, use the command `/tip` or `/tip [number]` to directly enter a specific tip amount.

**Custom option** - If you select this, **Dynamic Gas** is turned off and your **Custom Gas Price** will be used.

**Max Option** - To avoid overpaying for gas, set a **Max Gas**. If the gas exceeds this number, the transaction won't go through.

_**Max Option Example**_: If the **Instant Dynamic Gas** is 150 but your **Max Gas** is 120, the transaction is prevented, saving money on a potentially expensive trade.

**One-Step Action supported:** for example, `/gas 20` sets your Default Gas Price to 20.

### Set Slippage <a href="#slippage" id="slippage"></a>

**To enter the Slippage Menu, follow these steps:**

1. Navigate to the settings menu.
2. Select the "Slippage" option.

You can also access this using the quick panel by simply typing `/slippage`.

**The Tax Menu has 4 Options:**

1. **Auto Slippage** - The provided Buy/Sell Slippage from the Website API will be used. (Auto Slippage can be toggled On and Off).
2. **Default Slippage** - When **Auto Slippage is off** Or **When the Website API fails to get Auto Slippage**, Default Slippage is used.
3. **Leverage Slippage** - This is the slippage on top of the Website API Buy/Sell Slippage.
4. **Maximum Slippage** - Maximum slippage is used as a fail-safe for Auto Slippage. If Auto Buy/Sell Slippage is higher than Maximum Tax, the transaction will fail.

**Leverage Slippage Example**\
The token we want to buy has a Slippage of 10%, if we use 10% Slippage the transaction may fail, so we add **Leverage Slippage**. \
By default Sonic Sets Leverage Slippage to 2%, so the total Slippage to Use would be 12%, this prevents transaction Failure.

**Maximum Slippage Example**\
Someone launches a coin and sets slippage to 80%, my Maximum Slippage is set at 20%. \
I put through a trade of $500, this saves you 80% loss of funds of your $500 as you now prevented the transaction from going through through your Maximum Slippage set at 20%.

**Note** A World 🌎 Symbol Will Appear if the Website Api Was Used to Retrieve the Slippage Price. No world symbol means the Default Slippage Was Used.

One Step Action Also Supported, for example: `/slippage 10` (This will set Default Slippage to 10.)

**Note:** If you enter 0 or 100 there is **"No Slippage" (Not Recommended for MEV Bots)**

The **Security Settings** can be accessed from the `/settings` menu. Additionally, you can access it from the Snipe menu or by typing `/security`.

The Security Settings menu offers several options to enhance the security of your account within the Sonic Snipe Bot:

#### **🔑 Set Password**

Setting a password is a fundamental step in securing your account. This ensures that only you can access your account and its features.

**Benefits of Setting a Password:**

* 🛡️ Protects your account from unauthorised access.
* 💰 Enables wallet and bridge transfers.
* 🔒 Allows you to lock your account, preventing trading activities while you're away.

**Recommendation:**\
When you first create an account, you’ll be prompted to set a password. If you haven’t done so yet, we **strongly recommend** setting one to ensure your account's security.

***

#### **📧 Set an Email**

Linking an email address to your account is important for account recovery. If you forget your password or need to verify your identity, your email will help us restore access to your account.

**Additional Security:**\
This extra layer of security ensures we can assist you in recovering access to your account if needed. 📩

***

#### **🔒 Lock/Unlock Your Account**

If you're not using your account for an extended period, consider locking it to prevent any unauthorized activity. Locking your account ensures no trades or other sensitive activities take place while you're away.

**Features of Account Lock:**

* 🚫 Prevents trading, limit trading, and sniping new launches.
* 🔄 Existing limit trades and snipes will continue running, even if your account is locked.

**Unlocking Your Account:**\
To resume trading and regain access to all features, simply unlock your account from the security settings. 🔓

***

#### **🏷️ Set an Alias**

Setting an alias personalises your presence within the Sonic Snipe Bot platform. Your alias is used for identification in the leaderboard and community updates.

**Why Set an Alias?**

* 🌟 **Public Recognition:** Your alias will help others identify you when your trades or purchases are highlighted for VIP members.
* 👤 **Maintain Privacy:** If you prefer to stay anonymous, you can choose an alias that doesn't directly identify you, or set your alias as “anon.”
* 🤝 **Increased Engagement:** A recognisable alias fosters engagement within the community, allowing others to see your activity and contributions.

**How to Set an Alias:**\
Click on **Set an Alias** or type **/alias**. A prompt will appear where you can either:

* ✍️ Type your username to use it as your alias.
* 🕵️‍♂️ Type “anon” to remain anonymous.

Once set, your alias will be displayed in your next trade and within community updates. 🌐
