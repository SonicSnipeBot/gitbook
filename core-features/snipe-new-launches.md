### Snipe On Feature <a href="#snipe-on" id="snipe-on"></a>

The **Snipe On** feature allows users to initiate a snipe based on specific contract events defined by the developer.

#### Usage

To use this feature, simply navigate to the **Snipe On** section and select the desired trigger event. For instance, if you aim to execute a snipe upon the occurrence of either "Open Trading" or "Enable Trading" events, you would activate the corresponding button, typically labeled as "openTrading".

#### Default Settings

By default, the feature is set with the following options:

* **üíß Liquidity ‚úÖ**: This option is pre-selected. Users have the choice to deselect it if they prefer to wait for other specific events like "Enable Trading" or "Open Trading".
* **üìö Functions ‚úÖ**: Also selected by default. Users can deselect this option if they wish to focus solely on liquidity events, or they may opt to deactivate both liquidity and functions to utilize the Anti Rug Feature exclusively.

> **Note:** Users are advised to carefully select triggers that maximize the chances of a successful snipe. Recommended options often include "Enable Trading" or "Open Trading".

### Anti Rug Feature <a href="#antirug" id="antirug"></a>

#### How Does Anti Rug Work?

The Anti Rug feature is designed to safeguard your investments by detecting and front-running malicious transactions initiated by developers. This preemptive action aims to sell your tokens before they are impacted by such transactions.

**Key Aspects:**

* **Activation Without Sniping:** Anti Rug can be enabled independently from the 'Snipe On' feature. To do so, deselect both the 'Liquidity' and 'Function' options under 'Snipe On'.
* **Recommended Usage:** This feature is particularly beneficial when holding a substantial volume of tokens. Be mindful of the potential high gas fees incurred due to the front-running process.
* **Multiple Wallets Support:** When enabled, Anti Rug attempts to simultaneously front-run and sell tokens across all configured wallets.

**Challenges and Limitations:**

While Anti Rug is a robust tool, it's important to recognize that its effectiveness can be impacted by various developer tactics. Developers may employ strategies like simulating liquidity removal to thwart sniping attempts. Additionally, it is not guaranteed that a front-run attempt will always be successful. Users should be aware of these potential limitations and exercise caution.

#### Identifying Malicious Transactions

Anti Rug primarily focuses on countering activities such as:

* Transactions triggering liquidity removal.
* Transactions involving token minting.
* Other malicious activity that is deemed harmful.

#### Activation Instructions

To enable the Anti Rug feature, tick the 'Anti Rug' checkbox in the settings. This option is typically enabled by default for user convenience.

> **Note:** Ensure your wallet is sufficiently funded to handle the potentially high gas costs associated with activating the Anti Rug feature.
