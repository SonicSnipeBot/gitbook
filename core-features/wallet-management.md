### Wallet keys <a href="#display-wallet-keys" id="display-wallet-keys"></a>

To view your private keys:

1. Navigate to the settings menu.
2. Select the "My Keys" option.
3. Enter your password that you entered when you configured the snipe bot.

Access quickly by typing `/keys`

**Note:** If you've forgotten your password, you will not have access to the private keys. You have to delete all wallets and re-configure the snipe bot.

**Note:** If you didn't set a password on startup, you will not need to enter a password. It is important to set a password on startup as it protects your Wallet Keys. If someone has access to your telegram accounts, they can easily access your keys if you don't set a password.
