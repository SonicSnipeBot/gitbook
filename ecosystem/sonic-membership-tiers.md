**ðŸ’° Standard Account Fee Accumulation:**

Fees are accumulated progressively and are automatically transferred once a certain threshold is reached.

**For Example:**

* I execute a Buy Trade for $10.
* I execute a Sell Trade for $100.
* After multiple trades, my total trading volume reaches $1000.
* With a trading fee of 1%, I will be charged a fee of $10.

Once the accumulation amount is reached, you will receive a notification detailing the fee deduction. You can also view your fee summary by accessing the `/stats` command.

### ðŸ“Š Token Adjustment Policy

To maintain fairness and reflect market dynamics, the number of tokens required for each membership tier may be adjusted based on the trading price of Sonic tokens.

* For example, if the price of Sonic tokens triples, the token requirement for memberships may decrease proportionally.
* Similarly, adjustments may occur at any time to ensure competitive alignment with the market and for the overall benefit of the Sonic ecosystem.

#### **ðŸ”” Transparent Communication**

Any adjustments to the token requirements will be **announced in advance** to ensure transparency and avoid any confusion within the community.

This approach ensures that:

* Fees remain a sustainable driver of the Sonic ecosystem.
* Accessibility is balanced with ecosystem growth and liquidity support.

### ðŸ’§ **Maintaining Strong Liquidity for the Sonic Token**

Regardless of account tier, certain sale proportions of the Sonic token through our supported service may include a nominal fee where the transaction may impact liquidity. This liquidity-supporting fee acts as an anti-dump mechanism, helping ensure stability and depth in trading while strengthening the Sonic ecosystem as a whole. The proportion of this fee allocated to buybacks will be determined based on the impact on liquidity, with some of the amount reserved as needed to support Sonic token buybacks.
