# Sonic Revenue Share

**Sonic Revenue Share Program**

We believe in sharing success with those who support and grow our ecosystem. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re excited to introduce **Sonic Revenue Share**, a unique program designed to reward our most dedicated Sonic Token holders and active community members.

#### How It Works?

Each Epoch, trading fees on Sonic are distributed among top Sonic token holders. The number of eligible holders will be determined and announced with each distribution.

**Revenue Share Allocation (Best Scenario)**

* **40% to the Community**: This represents an aspect of Sonic's Utility, rewarding loyal holders and potentially includes our Earn Through Engagement Program (details to be confirmed).
* **30% to Development**: Supporting development and operations.
* **10% to Marketing**: Fuelling growth and expanding our reach.
* **10% to Treasury**: Ensuring long-term sustainability and stability.
* **10% to BuyBack:** Used to Buy back of the Sonic Token

> **Note:** The allocation above reflects the best-case scenario for revenue sharing, actual distributions may vary by epoch based on strategic considerations. While we remain committed to rewarding holders, and staking already provides incentives, revenue share allocations will be adjusted based on earnings. This ensures that while holders benefit, a strong focus is maintained on development and platform growth to support long-term sustainability and ecosystem expansion.\
