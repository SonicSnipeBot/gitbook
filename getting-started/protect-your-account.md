#### **🔑 Set Password**

Setting a password is a fundamental step in securing your account. This ensures that only you can access your account and its features.

**Benefits of Setting a Password:**

* 🛡️ Protects your account from unauthorised access.
* 💰 Enables wallet and bridge transfers.
* 🔒 Allows you to lock your account, preventing trading activities while you're away.

**Recommendation:**\
When you first create an account, you’ll be prompted to set a password. If you haven’t done so yet, we **strongly recommend** setting one to ensure your account's security.

***

#### **📧 Set an Email**

Linking an email address to your account is important for account recovery. If you forget your password or need to verify your identity, your email will help us restore access to your account.

**Additional Security:**\
This extra layer of security ensures we can assist you in recovering access to your account if needed. 📩

***

#### **🔒 Lock/Unlock Your Account**

If you're not using your account for an extended period, consider locking it to prevent any unauthorized activity. Locking your account ensures no trades or other sensitive activities take place while you're away.

**Features of Account Lock:**

* 🚫 Prevents trading, limit trading, and sniping new launches.
* 🔄 Existing limit trades and snipes will continue running, even if your account is locked.

**Unlocking Your Account:**\
To resume trading and regain access to all features, simply unlock your account from the security settings. 🔓

***

#### **🏷️ Set an Alias**

Setting an alias personalises your presence within the Sonic Snipe Bot platform. Your alias is used for identification in the leaderboard and community updates.

**Why Set an Alias?**

* 🌟 **Public Recognition:** Your alias will help others identify you when your trades or purchases are highlighted for VIP members.
* 👤 **Maintain Privacy:** If you prefer to stay anonymous, you can choose an alias that doesn't directly identify you, or set your alias as “anon.”
* 🤝 **Increased Engagement:** A recognisable alias fosters engagement within the community, allowing others to see your activity and contributions.

**How to Set an Alias:**\
Click on **Set an Alias** or type **/alias**. A prompt will appear where you can either:

* ✍️ Type your username to use it as your alias.
* 🕵️‍♂️ Type “anon” to remain anonymous.

Once set, your alias will be displayed in your next trade and within community updates. 🌐

### 2. **Telegram Account Security** 🔐

Steps to securing your **Telegram** account directly, ensuring that your information stays safe while using Sonic Snipe Bot.

#### **🛡️ Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

To further secure your **Telegram** account, we highly recommend enabling **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**. This provides an additional layer of protection by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone) when logging in.

**How to Enable 2FA:**

1. Go to **Settings > Privacy and Security > Two-Step Verification**
2. Follow the steps to enable 2FA and secure your Telegram account.

**Recommendation:**\
Enabling **2FA** is an essential step in protecting your account from unauthorised access, and we strongly advise doing this immediately. 🔐

#### **🚫 Prevent Third-Party Access**

Be cautious when granting third-party applications access to your **Telegram** account. Only interact with trusted services, and never allow access to your account or personal information unless you are confident in their legitimacy. 🕵️‍♂️

**Recommendation:**\
Do not allow third-party applications to access your **Telegram** account unless you **fully trust** them. If you're unsure, it’s safer to **decline their request for access**. 🚷
