# Security

### Security Overview

Sonic Snipe Bot priorities the security of its users' information and trading activities. Our platform implements a range of robust measures designed to ensure the safety and privacy of all users. Below are some of the key security features:

***

#### **1. Secure Storage of Private Keys**

* **AES-256-CBC Encryption**: All private keys associated with user accounts are securely stored and encrypted using the AES-256-CBC encryption algorithm. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the private keys, which are essential for executing secure cryptocurrency transactions.
* **Access Control**: Access to private keys is strictly controlled. The encrypted private key is only decrypted when necessary for performing transactions. This limits the exposure of sensitive data and reduces the risk of unauthorised access.

***

#### **2. Key Management and Decryption**

* **Decryption Key Handling**: The encryption key used to decrypt private keys is not stored on the server. Instead, the decryption key is securely encrypted in memory. Authorized personnel must manually input a password upon system startup to decrypt the key. This process ensures that the decryption key is only accessible when the service is intentionally started and only by authorized personnel.
* **User-Specific Data Encryption**: Each user's private keys are encrypted separately, using unique encryption practices. This means that no two users' private keys are encrypted in the same way, which adds an extra layer of security.
* **User Access to Private Keys**: If a user has set a password for their account, they must input this password to access their private keys. This ensures that even though the private keys are stored on the server, only the user can unlock them, protecting their sensitive data.
* **Decryption Process**: The decryption process is manually initiated by authorized personnel when the system starts, ensuring that the system is not vulnerable to unauthorized access. While system data is decrypted to access necessary files, user-specific data like private keys is decrypted using a more secure and separate process.

***

#### **Application-Level Security**

* **Enhanced Application Security**: The trading application is designed with advanced security measures to protect against unauthorized access or tampering. This ensures that the application remains secure, even in the event of a security breach, providing an additional layer of protection to the platform as a whole.
* **Code Protection**: To further safeguard the platform, sensitive parts of the application are obscured using techniques that make it more challenging for malicious actors to analyse or exploit any potential vulnerabilities. This additional layer of obfuscation helps reduce the risk of exploitation.

***

#### **4. Limited Access Restrictions**

* **Access Control**: Sonic Snipe Bot implements strict access control measures to safeguard all aspects of the platform’s infrastructure. Servers are regularly updated with the latest security patches, and access to user data is only granted to authorised personnel based on the principle of least privilege.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Users are strongly encouraged to enable 2FA for their Telegram accounts, adding an additional layer of security to protect against unauthorised logins.

***

#### **5. Continuous Security Updates**

* **Proactive Security**: Sonic Snipe Bot constantly monitors and updates its security protocols to ensure that the platform is protected against the latest security threats. Regular audits and penetration testing are conducted to identify and fix any potential vulnerabilities in the system.
* **Security Alerts**: Users are notified of important security updates, such as changes to encryption practices or new security features, through the platform’s communication channels.

***

#### **6. Security of User Data**

* **Data Encryption**: All personal and transactional data collected by the platform is encrypted to protect it from unauthorised access. Encryption is applied to both data at rest (stored data) and data in transit (data being transmitted over the network).
* **Secure Storage of User Information**: Sonic Snipe Bot ensures that user data, including payment information and transaction history, is securely stored using best practices in data security.

***

#### **7. Regular Security Audits**

* **Security Audits and Oversight**: Sonic Snipe Bot collaborates with experienced third-party security professionals to conduct regular security audits of the platform. These audits are essential for identifying and addressing any potential weaknesses. Additionally, our internal team oversees and reviews these audits when needed or necessary to ensure that the platform consistently adheres to the highest security standards.
* **Vulnerability Management**: Any vulnerabilities identified during audits are swiftly addressed by both the third-party experts and our in-house team. We continuously enhance the platform’s security measures to ensure its resilience against evolving threats.

#### **8. User Responsibilities**

* **Strong Password Practices**: Users are advised to use strong, unique passwords for their accounts and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to secure their accounts.
* **Account Monitoring**: Users should regularly monitor their accounts for unauthorised activity and report any suspicious transactions immediately.
* **Phishing Protection**: Users should be cautious of phishing attempts and ensure that they are interacting with official channels of Sonic Snipe Bot. The platform will never ask users for sensitive information such as passwords or private keys.

#### **9. Protect Your Account**

To fully protect your account, it's essential to secure both your Sonic Snipe Bot account and your Telegram account. Here are some recommended steps to enhance the security of your accounts:

1. **In-App Security Settings**
   * **Set Password**: Ensure you set a strong password to protect your account from unauthorized access.
   * **Set an Email**: Link an email address for account recovery and verification.
   * **Lock/Unlock Your Account**: Lock your account when not in use to prevent unauthorized trading.
   * **Set an Alias**: Protect your privacy with an alias, especially in public leaderboards or community updates.
2. **Telegram Account Security**
   * **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Secure your Telegram account with 2FA to prevent unauthorized logins.
   * **Prevent Third-Party Access**: Be cautious of third-party applications requesting access to your Telegram account. Only allow trusted services to interact with your account.

#### **10. Telegram API Security**

*   **Telegram API Integration**: Sonic Snipe Bot utilizes the Telegram API to send messages and handle transactions between users and the platform. This process ensures secure and encrypted communication between the user, the Telegram server, and the Sonic Snipe Bot platform.

    **How it Works**:

    1. The user sends a response via their Telegram account through @SonicSnipeBot.
    2. The Telegram server receives and forwards this response.
    3. Our server receives the response from Telegram and processes the user's trade or request.
    4. The platform executes the necessary action on our server.
    5. We send the handled response back to the Telegram server.
    6. The Telegram server then sends the final response to the user via @SonicSnipeBot, confirming the transaction.
* **Encrypted Secure Channels**: All communication between the Telegram server and Sonic Snipe Bot is conducted through secure, encrypted channels, ensuring that data is protected during the entire transaction process.
* **Telegram Account Protection**: Users are strongly encouraged to secure their Telegram accounts by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) and being cautious of third-party applications requesting access to their account. This adds an extra layer of security to protect users' communications.
