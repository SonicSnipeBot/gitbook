#### 19. Revenue Share & Airdrop Terms

**19.1 Overview**

As part of the Sonic Revenue Share program, Sonic Snipe Bot may periodically conduct buybacks of the Sonic Token ($Sonic) and distribute a portion of the acquired tokens through an airdrop to top holders of Sonic Tokens. **Please note that the eligibility for, and the amount of, each airdrop is at the Provider's sole discretion and may vary based on platform revenue, strategic decisions, and market conditions**. The criteria for determining top holders and the amount to be distributed to each group may change over time based on platform revenue and strategic considerations. **The amount allocated to each group of holders** will vary depending on the total number of eligible holders and available tokens for each airdrop.

**19.2 Airdrop Eligibility Criteria**

* **Top Holders**: To qualify for the airdrop, users must be among the top holders of Sonic Tokens at the time the airdrop is conducted. The **criteria for "top holders"** may change with each airdrop event. The allocation of tokens to each group will be proportional to the holdings of users in relation to the total available airdrop tokens.
* **Calculation of Top Holders**: The number of eligible holders and the percentage of tokens allocated to each group is calculated at the discretion of the Provider using both proprietary software and third-party services like Blockvision’s API. The top holders for each airdrop are determined based on the **current token holdings** of users at the time of the calculation, which may occur within a 24-hour window or any other timeframe as decided by the Provider.

**19.3 Airdrop Distribution Mechanism**

* **Amount per Group**: The amount to be airdropped to each holder is determined by the **percentage of total holdings** of each wallet relative to the total eligible holdings in each category. **The distribution for each group** (such as holders with more than 1%, 0.2%, etc.) may vary with each distribution, based on available revenue and strategic decisions made by the Provider.
* **Software and API Usage**: While the Provider utilizes Blockvision’s API and other third-party services to assess the eligibility of holders, the final airdrop distribution will be determined by the Provider’s **internal software**. Due to potential discrepancies or inaccuracies in third-party data, the Provider cannot be held responsible for errors in determining eligibility or airdrop amounts.

**19.4 Disputes Regarding Airdrop Eligibility**

* **Dispute Window**: If you believe you should have received an airdrop but were not included in the published list, you must submit a dispute within **72 hours** from the time the airdrop list is made publicly available. After 72 hours, no further disputes will be accepted, and the Provider will have no obligation to address any claims or provide retroactive adjustments.
* **Dispute Process**: All disputes must be submitted through **official communication channels**, and users must provide sufficient evidence to support their claim. The Provider reserves the right to reject any dispute deemed frivolous, untimely, or unsupported by adequate evidence.
* **Discretion in Final Decision**: The Provider maintains full discretion in determining eligibility and resolving any disputes. All decisions made by the Provider regarding airdrop eligibility, amounts, and recipients are **final and binding**.

**19.5 Limitations and No Guarantees**

* **No Guaranteed Airdrops**: Participation in the Sonic Snipe Bot ecosystem does not guarantee eligibility for an airdrop. Airdrop distributions are contingent upon the **availability of tokens**, **platform revenue**, and **strategic decisions** made by the Provider. The amount and timing of each airdrop may vary depending on market conditions, revenue, and other factors.
* **Accuracy of Data**: While the Provider will make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of the airdrop process, **third-party data**, including that provided by Blockvision’s API, may contain inaccuracies. The Provider cannot be held responsible for any discrepancies, errors, or omissions in data used to determine airdrop recipients or amounts.

**19.6 Modifications to Airdrop Criteria and Process**

* **Right to Modify**: The Provider reserves the right to modify, pause, or discontinue the airdrop process, as well as adjust the eligibility criteria, at any time and without prior notice. This includes, but is not limited to, changes in the **criteria for "top holders"**, the **amount allocated to each group**, and the **timing of airdrop distributions**.
* **Program Suspension**: The Provider may suspend or cancel any ongoing airdrop if technical issues, fraudulent activity, or unforeseen circumstances arise that prevent a proper distribution. In such cases, the Provider will not be liable for any losses or damages resulting from the suspension or cancellation of an airdrop.

**19.7 Limitation of Liability**

The Provider shall not be held liable for any **losses, discrepancies, or issues** arising from the airdrop process, including but not limited to:

* **Failure to receive the airdrop** due to inaccuracies in third-party data, user error, or system malfunctions.
* **Delays, technical errors**, or issues related to the calculation or distribution of airdrops.
* **Loss of expected tokens** due to disputes that are not resolved in the user’s favor.

By using the Sonic Snipe Bot platform, the User acknowledges and agrees to these terms and waives any claim against the Provider arising from the airdrop process.
