# Sonic App Providers

## App Providers

Just as RPC providers funnel data on different routes, so does Sonic Snipe Bot! If you encounter an issue (though rare), you have the option to switch your bot to one of the following backup servers. Rest assured, all your data will remain the same.

Please note: Use only one bot at a time.

### Official Bot
